Custom DIY light-shelf for plants

Project Outline
---------------
In this project I decided to use some old fluorescent tubing hardware to build a light-shelf for my house plants. I wanted to use a rapsberry pi to control the lights, so I implemented this code to control the light circuit using a relay.

Possible Future Plans:
-------------
* Split control for top/bottom shelf so individual lights can be turned on/off at different times
* Use actual sunrise data to determine start/stop cycle
* Add web GUI with options
    * sunrise/sunset cycle
    * adjust cycle period
    * Manually trigger lights on/off
